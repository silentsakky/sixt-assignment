Application to load offers from API endpoint and show it in grid layout, it's using lazy loading of images to make it performant on mobile devices.

## Development

- It also sets up a proxy to http://cdn.sixt.io for loading the data, this is specified in package.json for development, this is required as server doesn't have enabled cors requests
